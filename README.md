# 🚀 Project architecture

This monorepo serves as the main entry point and controller for all microservices under a single gateway. It uses TypeScript, Express, and custom tooling to streamline development.

## 🐳 Docker Compose

This project comes with built-in support for Redis and RabbitMQ using Docker Compose.

### `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    container_name: rabbitmq
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: admin
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: admin

volumes:
  redis_data:
```

To start services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop services:
